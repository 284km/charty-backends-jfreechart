bar = charty.bar do
  series [0,1,2,3,4], [10,40,20,90,70], label: "sample1"
  series [0,1,2,3,4], [90,80,70,60,50], label: "sample2"
  series [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], [50,60,20,30,10, 90, 0, 100, 50], label: "sample3"
  range x: 0..10, y: 1..100
  xlabel 'foo'
  ylabel 'bar'
  title 'bar plot'
end
bar.render("sample_images/bar_jfreechart.png")
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
